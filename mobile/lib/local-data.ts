// Keeps the on-device caches (messages_cache, profiles_cache, signed_urls_cache and the persisted
// react-query cache) from leaking between accounts. The cache remembers which user it belongs to;
// whenever the signed-in user differs — sign-out, account switch, or a fresh sign-in as someone
// else, in any order and even if the app was killed mid-way — it is wiped before the new user's
// data can land in it. Driven from AuthProvider so no call site needs to remember to do it.
